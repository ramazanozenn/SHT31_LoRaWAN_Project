# SHT31_LoRaWAN_Project
SHT31 Temperature and Humidity Sensor Data Transmission over LoRaWAN  This project reads temperature and humidity values from the SHT31 sensor via I2C and sends the data to a LoRaWAN network. The code demonstrates sensor interfacing, data acquisition, and wireless transmission using LoRa technology.
